     Spirituality is a worldview that suggests there is a dimension to life that goes beyond what we experience physically and through
     our senses. It can involve religious or cultural practices and beliefs, a connection with others and the world, and self-improvement.
     It can also be used in a non-religious sense to refer to a preoccupation with or capacity to understand fundamental moral, existential, or metaphysical questions.
     <br><br>
     Hinduism, also known as Sanatana Dharma, is the world’s oldest living religion.
     Sanātana Dharma is a Sanskrit term that can be translated as "eternal religion" or "eternal law". 
     It can also mean "unshakeable, venerable order" or "ancient and continuing guideline".
     It is a natural religion, meaning its philosophies and practices are considered universally accessible through sincere study, reason, and experience apart from special revelation. 
     Hinduism is also an indigenous religion made up of a diverse family of philosophies and traditions that have been practiced primarily throughout Asia for thousands of years. 
     Today, Hinduism is a global religion with adherents representing virtually every racial, ethnic, and national background and living on every continent, and comprising majorities in three countries:
      <br>India, Nepal, and Mauritius.
     <br><br>
     The six Astika schools of Hindu philosophy, which recognise the authority of the Vedas, are: Sankhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Mimamsa, and Vedanta.
     Hindu texts have been classified into Sruti ("heard") and Smrti ("remembered"). The major Hindu scriptures are the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Purānas, the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Agamas.
     Prominent themes in Hindu beliefs include karma (action, intent and consequences) and the four Puruṣārthas, proper goals or aims of human life, namely: 
    
        <br>1) Dharma (ethics/duties)
        <br>2) Artha (prosperity/work)
        <br>3) Kama (desires/passions)
        <br>4) Moksha (liberation/freedom from the passions and the cycle of death and rebirth).
 
     <br>
     Hindu religious practices include devotion (bhakti), worship (puja), sacrificial rites (yajña), and meditation (dhyāna) and yoga.
     The use of the term Sanātana Dharma for Hinduism is a modern usage, based on the belief that the origins of Hinduism lie beyond human history, as revealed in the Hindu texts.
     Sanātana Dharma refers to "timeless, eternal set of truths" and this is how Hindus view the origins of their religion.
